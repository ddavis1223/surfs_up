## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine the temperature data for the months of June and Decmeber in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop buisness is sustainable year-round.

## Results
While comparing the differences in weather between June and December, we can conclude three major points:
     * The temperatures are somewhat similar between June and December whereby the maximum temperature in June is 85 and the maximum temperature in December is 83. 
     
     * The December Temps have a standard deviation of 3.745920 whereas the June Temps have a standard deviation of 3.257417.  This data shows that the December Temps is more spread out or dispersed than the June Temps.
     
     * The June Temps are a little over 3 degrees higher than the December Temps.
     
## Summary
As a result, the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu is pretty sustainable year-round for the surf and ice cream shop business to be successful.

I would also perform a precipitation query in order to gather more weather data for June and December.  This query will show how many wet days over the course in the particular months.
Also, I would perform a hours of daylight and twilight days that occurs in Oahu to determine how much light will be received on each given day.
